First Project in the Odin Project

This first project is to consolidate skills which have been learnt during the Foundations course of the Odin Project. These skills will be based solely around GIT and html usage in order to improve my web development skills. These skills along with my Engineering degree will allow me to improve my earnings and acquire a fulfilling job which suitsa both my lifestyle and allow me to have a great work/life balance while living comfortably.
